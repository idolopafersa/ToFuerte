## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. **Database Setup**

The database structure can be found in the `db` directory of this project. To load the database into your local MariaDB instance, use:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < path_to_db_file.sql
```

### 2. **Backend Setup**

1. Create a `.env` file with the database credentials:

    ```

2. The backend will run on  `8080` by default. To start the Go server, run:

    ```bash
    go run main/main.go
    ```

### 3. **Frontend Setup (React Native)**
